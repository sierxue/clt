## A Rectangle Learning Game

Consider a simple one-player learning game.
The objective of this game is to learn an unkonown rectangle $R$ -- a
rectangle in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}$ whose sides are parallel
with the coordinate axes.
The player receives information only through the following process: every
so often, a random point $p$ is chosen according to some fixed probability
distribution $\mathcal{D}$.
The player is given the point $p$ together with a label indicating whether 
the point is contained in $R$ (a positive example) or not contained in $R$ (a negative example).
Figure 1.1 shows the unknown rectangle region R along with a sample of
positive and negative examples.

The goal of the player is to use as few examples as possible, and as
little computation as possible, to pick a **hypothesis** rectangle which
is a good approximation to $R$.
Informally, the player's knowlege of $R$ is tested by picking a new point
at random from a given probability distribution $\mathcal{D}$,
and checking whether the player can decide whether the point falls inside
or outside of $R$.
Formally, we measure the error of $R^{\prime}$ as the probability that a
randomly chosen point from $\mathcal{D}$ falls in the region $R \Delta
R^{\prime}$, where $R\Delta R^{\prime} = (R-R^{\prime} \cup
(R^{\prime}-R)$.
