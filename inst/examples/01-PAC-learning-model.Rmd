## A Rectangle Learning Game

Consider a simple one-player learning game.
The objective of this game is to learn an unkonown rectangle $R$ -- a
rectangle in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}$ whose sides are parallel
with the coordinate axes.
The player receives information only through the following process: every
so often, a random point $p$ is chosen according to some fixed probability
distribution $\mathcal{D}$.
The player is given the point $p$ together with a label indicating whether 
the point is contained in $R$ (a positive example) or not contained in $R$ (a negative example).
Figure 1.1 shows the unknown rectangle region R along with a sample of
positive and negative examples.

The goal of the player is to use as few examples as possible, and as
little computation as possible, to pick a **hypothesis** rectangle which
is a good approximation to $R$.
Informally, the player's knowlege of $R$ is tested by picking a new point
at random from a given probability distribution $\mathcal{D}$,
and checking whether the player can decide whether the point falls inside
or outside of $R$.
Formally, we measure the error of $R^{\prime}$ as the probability that a
randomly chosen point from $\mathcal{D}$ falls in the region $R \Delta
R^{\prime}$, where $R\Delta R^{\prime} = (R-R^{\prime} \cup
(R^{\prime}-R)$.

To motivate the regtangle learning game, we consider a slightly more
concrete scenrio that is expressed as an instance of the game.
Suppose that we wanted to learn the concept of "men of medium build".
We assume that a man is of medium build if his height and weight lie in
prescribed ranges -- for instance, if his height is from five feet and six
inches to six feet and his weight is from 150 pounds to 200 pounds.
Then each man's build can be represented by a point in the Euclidean
plane, and the concept of medium build can be represented by an
axis-aligned rectangular region of the plane.
During the training phase, the learner is told for each new man he meets
whether that man is of medium build or not.
Over the period, the learner must form a model or hypothesis of the
concept of medium build.
